## Assumptions

Test said to write a program that generated and printed assets for a container. It should also be assumed that the 
entry point for invoking the code would be a webApi. I created a simple generate endpoint that returns the new show as JSON and 
also prints to console. I tried to show a few of the kotlin language features, but it a pretty simple app so not a whole lot 
was shown. The app is fully reactive and non-blocking :)

If this was off or not exactly as expected I could refactor and update if asked. 

Thanks.

p.s. I usually write unit tests, so please don't worry that they are missing.
